## Athropomorphism
Consider the similarities and the differences between human languages and programming languages.

Similarities:
* There is a syntax
  * structure to a languages
* Semantics
  * meaning to the language
* Can be used to express an algorithm

The difference? Computer languages are:
* Rigid & simple syntax
* Unambiguous
* Only for algorithms

## Considering Programming Languages
Fact: Through various methods, one program in any language can be created using *any* other language.

Question: So does it really matter which language you use for a project?

Answer: **Yes!**
Which computer language you use can influence how you think of the problem (i.e. recursive solutions) and how easily (or often) you make mistakes.

### Goals for Programming Languages
* Readable
* Simple to learn
* Portable (i.e. is it dependent on a specific OS like Mac?)
* Abstraction
  * control and data structures to hide details and organize
* Easy to catch errors early on through reading or simple debugging
* Can be compiled into efficient code

## Paradigms
**Paradigm** - how you look at the problem

Example: Print a large X pattern
```
X   X
 X X
  X
 X X
X   X
```
You can do this recursively or you can perhaps just iterate line by line.
